## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In the ideas section of the challenge, its suggested that the style is written using a pre-processor like Sass which I used in this project.

**honestly**, I wouldnt use it for a project of this size, and at this level of skill. 

**I learned** that there is much more to know about CSS before going to use a pre-processor.

I also learned that they are good to ease the process of managing your CSS if you have lots of code.

### Continued development

The main outcome of this challenge was to create a desponsive design, and its my first implementation of such thing. its a pretty simple one so I think the development will be working with more complex layouts with more elements.
